# Suade Lab Challenge

Coding exercise for Suade Lab.

## Exercise

For the given scenario, using the given technology, build a web app that fulfill all the scenario requirements.

We are expecting you to deliver your work as a GIT project (publicly hosted on GitHub), with a README file containing instructions on how to install/run the project.

The project should fit on a SPA (single page application) with multiple states and should allow the user to complete all listed user stories.

We value code testing greatly, so please write some tests (unit, integration and/or e2e tests)!

Use the following JSON file https://updates.suade.org/files/people.json as example of data structure.

Technology to use: VueJS (2 or 3) + Vuex + Vue router + Library of your choice
Scenario 1 â€“ Visualization Dashboard


The user should be able to:
 - see a paginated list of people.
 - do a full text search to dynamically filter the results (searching on all fields).
 - visualise the data as a pie chart.
 - visualise the data as a bar chart.
 - create dynamic interactions between charts (filtering from chart).
 - edit the data with a table or modal.
 - BONUS: add a geographic chart.
